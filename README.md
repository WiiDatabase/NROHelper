NRO Helper
==========
Handy little Python script which can extract Icon, NACP and RomFS from Switch NRO files. It exposes all information through a NRO class and subclasses like NACP.

## TODO
- [ ] Support NROs without assets (e.g. libtransistor)
- [ ] Support modifying NACP (name, author, version) and icon
